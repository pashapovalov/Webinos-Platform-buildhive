An experimental Webinos demo project. Build it with ant

   ant debug

This experimental Android app supports:

   -  multicast advertisements of the phone on SSDP every few seconds
   -  very simple http server run as a background thread c/o AsyncTask
   -  /phone.xml for the device/service description (faked)
   -  /favicon.ico  (will try to get this to be the webinos one)
   -  GET or POST /photo to grab frame from video preview of front camera
   -  POST /vibrate to vibrate the phone
   -  support for GET foo.html on files in sdcard/web/foo.html
   -  CORS header to allow access by scripts from other "sites"

This is part of a discovery demo on Linux notebook. The support 
for SSDP is very rudimentary, and looking forward I expect to 
expand this and to also support mDNS. The demo is for now limited 
to Android 2.3.6. 

The video preview appears when you launch the app. This raises the 
question of the user interface on the phone for the services it 
exposes.

The installable APK file is bin/PZP-debug.apk

You can copy it to your sdcard via USB and then install it e.g. with
ES File Explorer.
