Policy manager implementation (c/c++) for use in an Android JNI project.

To compile the code for an Android JNI project:
- install the NDK by CrystaX (http://www.crystax.net/en/android/ndk/6#download)
- add the file ./libcrypto.so in path_to_android_ndk/build/platforms/android-(version)/arch-(arm|x86)/usr/lib/
- add path_to_android_ndk to the environment variable PATH
- execute "ndk-build" in ./

You can find the resulting libpolicymanager.so in a subfolder of ./libs/
