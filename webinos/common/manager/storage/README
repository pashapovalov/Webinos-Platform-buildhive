PZP Storage

Code
----

This is a VERY early example of what we could do for encrypted storage.

Update: it now REQUIRES two node.js modules: Zipper and zipFile.  Please install with npm globally - "npm install -g zipper zipfile"

To use it, call "open", then access files as normal in the directory you used as an argument.  When you are finished, call "close".

Tests are run through maven.  All code should pass JSLint, too, although the tests wont.
